JQuery File Uploader

Allows uploading of multiple files via AJAX. The imageOnly mode also displays a thumbnail of the image before upload. Current HTML input fields do not allow the transfer of files via AJAX. With Uploader, files are encoded into base64 and sent in three arrays: base64 data, file names, and file types. The server would then take the data, decode the base64 to binary and save to disk.
